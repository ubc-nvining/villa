# 📜 Awesome Scroll Tools [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Here are all the awesome awarded open source contributions from our community that will allow us to read the scrolls! 📚✨

Contributions are divided into four categories: _Data access/visualization_, _Segmentation_, _Ink Detection_, and _Other_.

Every category is subdivided in classes: 🌟 _Highlighted_ (for popular contributions), ⚙️ _Tools_, 📦 _Materials_, 📝 _Reports_, and 📊 _Visualization_.

Some highlighted contributions are added to this repository as submodules.

We keep this repository updated as much as we can, but research moves _fast_! 🏃💨

## 📊 Data access/visualization

### 🌟 Highlighted

- [vesuvius](https://github.com/scrollprize/vesuvius): Python library for accessing Vesuvius Challenge data. Allows direct access to scroll data without managing download scripts or storing terabytes of CT scans locally.

- [VC3D](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/villa/tree/main/volume-cartographer): the team’s interactive tool for viewing, segmenting, and virtually unwrapping scroll volumes.

- [Segment browser](https://github.com/jrudolph/vesuvius-browser) is a web-based tool to browse layers and open source ink detection results of all released segments. By Johannes Rudolph

### 🛠️ Tools

- [vesuvius-c](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/villa/tree/main/vesuvius-c): C library for accessing Vesuvius Challenge data (deprecated — prefer the [`vesuvius`](https://github.com/scrollprize/vesuvius) Python library or VC3D).

- [vesuvius-gui](https://github.com/jrudolph/vesuvius-gui) is a single binary GUI to render volumes and segments on-the-fly. By Johannes Rudolph

- [vesuvius-phalanx](https://github.com/mvrcii/phalanx): Python library / CLI for accessing Vesuvius data. Allows flexible access to volume and fragment scroll data. By Marcel Roth

- [llfio-chunkloader](https://github.com/climbmax123/LLFIOCunkloadingTestingAndBenching): A method to access data in chunks of (x,y,z) that is much faster and more compute-efficient than Zarr. (Written in C++ but it is possible to integrate in Python).

- [preprocessed-data](https://github.com/usc-caisplusplus/scroll-data-preprocessing): Data preprocessing code and a fully processed version of the dataset in .zarr format to allow for faster training of ink detection models. 
- [scroll-data-audit](https://github.com/Bullo27/scroll-data-audit) by Matteo Bulloni. Integrity auditor for the open-data: reconciles the catalog (`metadata.json`) against the actual Zarr arrays, filenames and scan metadata, and verifies multiscale pyramid value-correctness. Reported a Scroll 5 (PHerc0172) catalog shape error ([#1211](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/villa/issues/1211)) and certified the rest of the open-data consistent.

- [Region-of-interest inference for `vesuvius.predict`](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/villa/pull/1241): `--bbox "z0:z1,y0:y1,x0:x1"` restricts inference to one region of a volume, in global voxel coordinates, so `blend_logits` and `finalize_outputs` stay aligned. Only the chunks intersecting the region are streamed — on PHerc. Paris 4 a 200³ region reads 27 chunks (56.6 MB) instead of 10,368 (21.7 GB). By TAUIL Abd Elillah

- [Fourth placed Kaggle model finetuning](https://github.com/lukeboi/scroll-fourth-second/blob/master/README.md) on scroll data by Luke Farritor

- [Scroll pretraining](https://github.com/younader/VesuviusPretraining) by Youssef Nader. Youssef’s original idea for pretraining on the scrolls and finetuning on the fragments, which led him to winning the First Letters Prize.

#### 📦 Materials

- [Scroll 1 Ink Labels](https://discord.com/channels/1079907749569237093/1223849912467460116). Nicola Bodill produced more accurate labels for ink detection based on the prediction of the Grand Prize winner model

- [Scroll 4 predictions](https://dl.ash2txt.org/community-uploads/luke/youssef_uploads/scroll_4/). Youssef Nader produced some predictions on Scroll 4 from his Grand prize winner model. No sure trace of ink yet

- [Ink detection masks](https://discord.com/channels/1079907749569237093/1177039383375912990/1177039383375912990). Anton Repushko shared some ink labels for Scroll 1, these labels were used by many participants for their final submission in December 2023.
