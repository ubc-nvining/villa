"""Standalone debug tool: derive the expected spiral-space winding number of a
seed point from the winding annotations of the point-collections (pcls) that
reach its patch -- both directly-attached absolute-winding pcls and, by a
backwards BFS over patches, absolute-winding pcls on *other* patches that are
linked to the seed patch through a chain of relative-winding pcls.

It reuses fit_spiral's patch/point-collection loading phase and its spiral
transform, but does no fitting/training.

Two kinds of winding information feed the votes:

  * **Absolute-winding pcls** (metadata.winding_is_absolute): each attached point
    carries an *absolute* spiral winding number. A point on a patch is a winding
    "anchor" on that patch.
  * **Relative-winding pcls** (everything else): the difference of two of the
    pcl's points' wind_a annotations is the *relative* winding number between
    those two points (regardless of which patches they sit on). Treated as graph
    edges, they let an absolute anchor on one patch propagate to another.

The propagation, starting from the seed patch S (seed = a valid vertex near the
centre of S's grid):

  0. Direct votes: every absolute anchor attached to S votes for the seed's
     winding, propagating its absolute number from the anchor to the seed along
     a within-patch strip by counting discrete theta=0 branch crossings.
  1. Long-range votes: BFS the patch graph backwards from S. Relative pcls
     supply the edges -- for each relative pcl we walk its attached points in
     annotation order and connect each *consecutive* cross-patch pair (so the
     edge set stays a chain; more distant patches are reached transitively).
     Crossing an edge from patch P (departure point d) to patch R (arrival point
     e) costs the within-P strip delta from the entry point to d, plus the edge's
     wind_a difference (e minus d), adjusted when the two adjacent PCL points
     straddle theta=0. At every patch reached, its absolute anchors vote,
     propagated back to the seed through the accumulated chain.

Concretely, with strip_delta(P, a, b) := winding(b) - winding(a) measured by the
integer theta=0 branch transport of a within-P ij strip, each BFS state is
(patch P, entry point q on P, acc) with acc := winding(seed) - winding(q):

  * a vote from anchor a (absolute winding w) on P is
        winding(seed) = acc + w + strip_delta(P, a, q);
  * crossing a relative edge (P:d -> R:e, edge_delta = wind_a(e) - wind_a(d),
    with the adjacent-PCL theta=0 seam adjustment applied) sets
        acc' = acc - strip_delta(P, q, d) - edge_delta,  entry q' = e.

BFS marks each patch visited the first (fewest-hops) time it is reached, so it
explores a spanning tree of the reachable patches; --max-hops bounds the edge
depth (0 = direct anchors only, the original behaviour).

Relative edges that are *not* used as tree edges (they reconnect two patches both
already reached) are not discarded: each such edge closes a cycle, and we measure
its winding holonomy -- the difference between the winding it implies for the
arrival point and the winding the BFS tree already assigns there. A nonzero
holonomy means the relative-winding annotations do not close around that loop,
i.e. a winding inconsistency in the graph itself (independent of, and detectable
without, the absolute anchors). These are reported under "loops" in the output
(disable with --no-detect-loops). For each inconsistent loop we additionally
reconstruct the full cycle it closes -- the BFS-tree path between its two patches
plus the closing edge -- and record it under "loop_cycles" as an ordered patch/pcl
stack, which plot_winding_graph renders one loop at a time. Each cycle additionally
carries, per patch, the within-patch winding delta between its two cycle points (the
strip across a patch may itself cross theta=0), measured the same way as the tree
edges' intra-patch deltas.

Each within-patch winding delta is measured along a strip that follows a
fringe-avoiding shortest path through the patch's *valid quads only* (a weighted
Dijkstra on the quad grid, exactly like connect_overlapping_patches.py but within
one patch), then transforms that path to spiral space and theta=0-unwraps its
shifted radii. Sampling only valid quads keeps theta continuous so seam-crossing
counts reflect real branch transport (and whole windings on multi-winding patches)
instead of being thrown off by the wild theta swings of invalid regions. The
endpoints (annotated point / seed) are spliced onto the path's ends so the delta
is between the true points. The residual unwrapped shifted-radius gap is retained
as a diagnostic, but propagation uses the integer seam-crossing delta.

The transform's flow field is shaped by the checkpoint's own z-range; the
--z-range arg only filters patches/pcls (and must lie within the checkpoint's
range, like fit_spiral's resume path). Both are expressed in full-resolution
scan z, matching fit_spiral's z_begin/z_end constants.

Run from the spiral/ directory, e.g.

        --checkpoint out/.../checkpoint_fitted.ckpt \
