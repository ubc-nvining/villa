"""Three-way merge for VC3D fiber annotation JSON files.

Pure functions over parsed JSON dicts — no I/O, no S3 knowledge. vc_sync
imports this to auto-resolve conflicts where both machines changed a fiber
file since their last common synced version (the "base").

Design contract: merge output must load cleanly in an UNMODIFIED VC3D,
whose loader is strict and destructive (offering to delete inconsistent
branch links from disk, or dropping whole fibers from the session). The
invariants, from LineAnnotationController.cpp / Atlas.cpp:

- C1: every control point must appear in line_points, in order, within
  1e-8 (validateFiberInputControlPoints); violating this makes the whole
  file unloadable. Consequence: control_points and line_points must always
  be written as a consistent pair from the same source.
- C2: cross-fiber link reciprocity is index-exact across files, plus
  positions (1e-6) and directions.
- C3: stored link directions must match tangents recomputed from
  line_points within ~0.26 deg (branchDirectionsCompatible, 1e-5 on
  |cos theta|).

Merge semantics:

- Same geometry on both sides (the incident case — divergent link edits):
  geometry and derived fields come wholesale from the newer-generation
  side; branches merge with set semantics (additions from both sides
  survive, base-aware deletions, approvals beat both pending and
  deletion); tags merge base-aware. Loader-safe because every branch
  entry was written by VC3D against this exact geometry.
- Geometry changed on ONE side (including line-only re-optimizations):
  that side's control_points/line_points/hv are taken wholesale (C1 by
  construction); links from the other side are re-anchored by position.
- Geometry changed on BOTH sides in disjoint regions: control_points
  merge via diff3 (position-aligned against the base; overlapping edits
  conflict). The optimizer cannot run here, so line_points is set to the
  merged control points verbatim (C1 holds exactly) and the merged fiber
  is tagged `needs_reoptimization`; VC3D offers to re-fit the line on
  load.
- A link whose anchor control point was deleted by the merged geometry
  makes the whole merge a conflict: links are never silently dropped.
- After any merge that involves links, the caller must run
  refresh_pair_links() against each peer file (C2/C3): vc_sync mirrors
  the merged fiber's link decisions into the peers and uploads them.

A merge either succeeds cleanly or reports conflicts; it never guesses on
overlapping edits. Callers keep pre-merge copies of every input.
