    (the twin of the interactive launch gesture). The workspace's panes appear
    in vc3d_get_state's viewers and are drivable with vc3d_click / vc3d_drag.
    Add control points with plain vc3d_click (NOT vc3d_shift_click -- that
    triggers a different "predicted snap point" gesture on these panes).

    position: {"x","y","z"} in volume space (default) or {"x","y"} scene-space
    when space="scene". The point must lie on the target viewer's current
    view (same round-trip rule as vc3d_click); guessed volume xyz that is not
    on the visible slice fails -32003 "point is not on this viewer's view". If
    you do not already have an on-view point, either vc3d_center_viewer on the
    target first, or pass space="scene" with on-screen pixel coordinates (e.g.
    near the visible pane center) rather than guessing volume xyz. This opens
    the workspace and
    returns {"launched": true} even with no Lasagna dataset -- but TRACING
    needs one: seeding and every control point optimize against a
    manifest-backed Lasagna dataset (a "lasagna"-kind catalog representation)
    resolvable for the CURRENTLY SELECTED volume. Without one the panes open
    but no optimized line is produced (over the bridge the interactive "load
    lasagna normals" picker is suppressed, so the dataset must already be
    attached and its volume selected). Not every catalog sample/volume has one,
    and it resolves per-volume: a "normal_grids"-kind store is a DIFFERENT
    resource and does NOT satisfy this. Check vc3d_describe_catalog_sample for a
    "lasagna"-kind representation and vc3d_select_volume to the volume that
    carries it before tracing. This is unrelated to the vc3d_lasagna_* fit
    service.
    replace_owning: defaults True, which DISCARDS the caller's currently
    open/in-progress fiber workspace (verified: launching a second fiber with
    the default silently drops the first fiber's unsaved control points).
    Pass False to keep multiple fiber workspaces open at once, e.g. tracing
    several fibers before one combined vc3d_fiber_save.

    The workspace's viewer ids are NOT stable across edits -- each control
    point placed rebuilds/reoptimizes the panes under new "v<N>" ids. Call
    vc3d_get_state again before targeting a pane after any edit; a stale id
    fails -32002.
